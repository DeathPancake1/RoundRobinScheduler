# RoundRobinScheduler
One of the main functions of the operation system is to schedule processes that
the processor executes. One of the very popular algorithms for this scheduling
is called Round Robin, where each process enters a queue, executes in a FIFO
order, and after a specified time its execution stops and returns back at the end
of the queue if it still need time to continue execution or aborts if it has finished
its required time of execution.
You will be given a file with the name of the processes that needs execution,
time slot that it will enter the queue, and the needed time for its execution.
